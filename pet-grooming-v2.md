# Pet Grooming Landing Page V2 - Joyful Clay-Cloud

## Goal
Implement a premium, playful landing page with claymorphism, interactive package picker, organic draggable gallery, and a step-based booking system.

## Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Design System Update** → Update `tailwind.config.js` with "Joyful Clay-Cloud" palette (Peach, Sun Orange, Cream, Soft Lavender) and enhanced clay shadows. Verify: Colors and shadows available in dev tools.
- [ ] **Task 2: Global Styles** → Update `index.css` with custom "puffy" font styles and keyframe animations for organic floating effects. Verify: Floating effect works on simple elements.
- [ ] **Task 3: Base UI Components** → Refine `Card.jsx`, `Button.jsx`, and `Input.jsx` to match the "puffy" clay feel with inner shadows and bouncy feedback. Verify: Hovering/clicking buttons feels "squishy".
- [ ] **Task 4: Fragmented Hero Section** → Create a non-standard Hero with staggered elements and overlapping organic blobs. Verify: Layout is asymmetric and visually striking.
- [ ] **Task 5: Interactive Package Picker** → Build a service selection component with state-based clay bubbles that pop/scale when selected. Verify: Clicking a package updates the global "selected plan" state.
- [ ] **Task 6: Organic Draggable Gallery** → Implement a gallery where pet photos look like floating polaroids/stickers that can be dragged. Verify: Images can be moved and have realistic z-index layering.
- [ ] **Task 7: Step-based Booking Flow** → Convert the booking card into a 3-step wizard (Select Package -> Pet Details -> Appointment). Verify: Progress bar updates as user moves through steps.
- [ ] **Task 8: Enhanced Testimonials** → Implement large, breathable clay cards with staggered reveal animations. Verify: Cards "pop" into view as user scrolls.
- [ ] **Task 9: Final Layout Assembly** → Finalize `LandingPage.jsx` with all sections and ensure smooth scroll transitions. Verify: Full page audit with `ux_audit.py`.

## Done When
- [ ] Landing page has a distinct "Joyful Clay-Cloud" aesthetic (no standard splits).
- [ ] All interactive elements (Picker, Gallery, Booking) are fully functional.
- [ ] Performance and accessibility checks pass.
- [ ] "Wow" factor achieved via micro-animations and depth.
